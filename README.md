=================
Story:

You know, Steve really should not have jumped into that dark mineshaft.  
To be fair, the sign said “Monaco.”  How was he supposed to know he’d find
himself stuck in the smallest city he’s ever seen?  He’s pretty sure he’s not 
in Monaco, and that the flag is a lie.  Needless to say, he’s pretty lost, 
and the only clue he has are the two portals he can see in the horizon. Will he
be able to find a way home? Help Steve find the way to the portal and discover
what lies ahead.
